        <p>To use scala-js binding library in your project you should add it to your dependencies.</p>
        <p>You can depend on scala-js-binding library itself:</p>
        <textarea data-code="bindingDepend"></textarea>
        <p>Or you can use <i>binding-controls</i> library that contains UI controls and is based on scala-js-binding library</p>
        <textarea data-code="controlsDepend"></textarea>
      </div>
      <div class="ui column">
        <h1 class="orange header">Building from source and running examples</h1>
        <p>To build library from source and to look at some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Install sbt (from http://www.scala-sbt.org/ )</li>
