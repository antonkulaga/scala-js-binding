                Consider a simple example. Here you can see several text areas and inputs.

                <p class="ui segment">
                    In current example foo input/textarea are binded to <b>foo</b> variable, and bar - to <b>bar</b> variable,
                        you can notice binding by changing inputs/textareas text

                    Let's look into html part.
                    Here at the beginning property <b>data-view="random"</b>  attaches <b>RandomView</b> scala class to corresponding div tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                Then one <b>h1</b> with id "count" is completely binded to some html property of RandomView. Then several inputs are binded to corresponding
                    string reactive variable ( data-bind="foo" and data-bind="bar")
                </p>
                <p>
                    All bindings inside of children tags will be to properties of this view. There is a view hierarchy. Each view can have subviews.
                    Usually mains view attached to body tag is created. In quoted sample there are bindings to isSigned and logoutClick reactive variables.

                Let's look into scala part
                </p>
                <p>
                There you can see that counting variable is a reactive variable (see scala.rx) that is binded to scalatags HtmlTag proeprty.
                Conting content is being changed in some tiem intervals constantly by update function, changes are automaticly propogated to the ui.
                </p>
                <p>Situation is simpler with foo and bar that are just reactive variables of string type. The main rule is that data-bind="name" should
                    equal corresponding scala property name.
                </p>
                <p>In order to connect data-bind="name" with corresponding scala view property macroses are used. Under the hood maps of different types are
                    created and during the bindind process the code searches propertyes in this maps.
                    Unfortunately I could not avoid manual initiation of such maps
