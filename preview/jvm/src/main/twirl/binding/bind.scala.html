                <h1 class="ui orange header">How do reactive variables work?</h1>
                <p>Reactive variables are smart variables who automatically update themselves when the values they depend on change (see <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/scala.rx">scala.rx docs</a> to understand the concept better).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the sake of example let's make several reactive variables that depend on each other. Here is an image of the dataflow graph.
                </p>
                <p>When you change <b>a</b> or <b>b</b> changes are propagated to all reactive variables that depend on them.
                    As you see from a code example and a live demo one the right it is just a matter of several lines of code to compose a data-flow with reactive variables.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    The mission of Scala-js binding library is to connect HTML properties, styles and events to scalajs classes and different variables inside them.

                <h1 class="ui orange header">How do views work?</h1>
                <p>Views are ScalaJS classes that contain most of interface logic and that connect to HTML Trees.
                    If you bind HTML property to a reactive variable it looks first in which view this HTML element is
                    and then searchers for the reactive variable inside this view.
                </p>
                <p>Let's look ScalaJS view and HTML part of our first example with numbers.</p>
                <textarea data-code-scala="flowViewScala"></textarea>
                <p>
                    The view contains our reactive variables and also has <i>elem</i> variable that contains an HTML element to which the view is connected.
                    If you look at HTML template on the right you can notice that there are no parts there that are not compatible with HTML5 specification.
                    The logic how html properties are binded to variables is defined by the <i>Binder</i> classes that are applied to the view.
                    The default(GeneralBinder) binder uses <b>data-<i>property</i>="<i>variable</i>"</b> HTML attributes to connect HTML properties with variables.
                    There is no need to hardcode HTML templates into scala-js code, so you can use any template engine you want or even just ordinary HTML files
               </p>

                <p>In the HTML code on your right you can see <b>data-view="CodeExampleView"</b>. This property connects CodeExampleView to the corresponding class.
                    As ScalaJS does not support reflection you have to register string "CodeExampleView" to corresponding View in a parent class.
                </p>
                <p>We also have to register our view in the parent view.
                    In our case Parent is the main view of the application. Here is its code:</p>
                <textarea data-code-scala="registration"></textarea>
                <p>
                    Together with registration binders are attached to the view.
                    In current example we create GeneralBinder that is capable of connecting reactive variables to html properties but you can attach any binders you want.</p>
                    <p>
                        Binders use macros to extract reactive variables from the class that is why we create it inside withBinder function.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Then we connect html inputs and labels with reactive variables inside this view, it is done by <b>data-bind="<i>variableName</i>"</b>, and that's it, now it works!
                </p>

                <p>The most used type of binders in scala-js-binding is General binder.
                    Here are <b>data-*="<i>something</i>"</b> attributes that it recognizes:
                </p>

                    <li>
                        <b>data="<i>varname</i>"</b> - if it is input or textarea - binds reactive variable
                        to <i>value</i> property , for all other HTML elements - binds to textContent property
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>data-bind-<i>property</i>="<i>varname</i>"</b> - binds <i>property</i> attribute or HTML property to
                        <i>varname</i> reactive variable
                    </li>

                        <i>varname</i> reactive variable
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>data-showif="<i>varname</i>"</b> - if boolean reactive variable with corresponding name is true then shows HTML element

                    <li>
                        <b>data-hideif="<i>varname</i>"</b> - if boolean reactive variable with corresponding name is true
                        then hides (by setting display = none ) HTML element
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>data-class-<i>classname</i>if="<i>varname</i>"</b> - if boolean reactive variable with corresponding name is true
                        then add CSS class to HTML element
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>data-event-<i>eventname</i>="<i>varname</i>"</b> - binds event (for instance click or mousemove event) to corresponding reactive variable.
                        You can add handlers and further processing to this reactive variable.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            In binding-controls and semantic-binding subprojects there are also some predefined binders that you can use out of the box:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <i>CodeBinder</i> that can be used to display programming code</li>
                    <li> <i>NavigationBinder</i> to create AJAX menus</li>
                    <li> <i>RDFBinder</i> that support RDFa and allows you to bind HTML to RDF properties</li>
                    <li>etc.</li>
