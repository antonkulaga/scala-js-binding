                    On the right you can see a sample of menu. There data-param-path makes a request to corresponding
                    address and loads a menu into the page. Scala-js-pickling library is used to pickle and unpickle results, that means
                    that you can pass any case class, pickle it on the server and unpickle on the client without a need to write custom json (de)serialization,
                    the only thing that is required is to register this class with pickl register as well as classes that are in fields of your case class.

                    On the right you can see a code required for the menu to appear. There data-param-path makes a request to corresponding
                    address and loads a menu into the page.
                    In current example there is a tag with data-template="true"  this tag is a template for each item that will be created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each item has data-load-into attribute. This attribute defined where the data should be loaded after menu is clicked. Usually
                    data is loaded with ajax into some html element to avoid whole page refreshing. For binding to item properties data-bind is used
                    instead of ordinary data-bind. The only difference between them is that data-bind binds to the whole view and data-bind binds
                    to current item.

                </p>
                <p>You can edit template on the right and push <b>apply template</b> and the template will be rerendered according new template</p>
