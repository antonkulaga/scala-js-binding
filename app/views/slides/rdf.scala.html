                <p>On your right you can see data loaded from play backend. You can change and save it to the server (inmemory collection is used for this demo).</p>
                <p> If you look into HTML you will see "property" attribute and "shape" attribute.
                    In RDF databases everything is described as statements ( subject -- predicate --object --context)
                    Each resource can have many statements about it </p>
                <p>Here HTML view is binded to the resource (by "data-param-resource" attribute) and "property" attribute defines  which properties of the resource to fetch.
                    There is also "data-param-shape" that defines a shape of resource. Shapes are like forms or dataviews, they define a list of properties to be loaded
                    for the resource and some contraints for them (like type, cardinality and so on)
                </p>
                <p>In this example remote fetching of RDF properties is shown, but you can write a code that will fetch any other kind of data</p>
